## About this template

This email template is meant to provide a single template that can be
viewed by both desktop and mobile users. It has been tested in Outlook
2007, Outlook 2010, Mac Mail, Android Mail, iOS Mail, Gmail, and Yahoo
Mail.

It’s not ready to go out of the box — you’ll need to add your own
formatting and images — but the structure will provide you with a
working base to get your project started.

Responsivity is functional across all native mail clients. Due to
software limitations of the Gmail and Yahoo Mail clients, mobile users
of the Gmail and Yahoo Mail apps will receive a smaller version of the
desktop email. All other users will see responsive changes in mobile
environments.

It is important to note that the same code and assets are used to
display both versions of this template. Therefore, your design must
account for all images having the same aspect ratio across all devices.
